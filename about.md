# About VCF vs Control Proteomics Analysis

This application provides interactive visualization and analysis tools for proteomics data comparing VCF and Control samples.

## Features

- **Dataset Overview**: View sample information and basic statistics
- **PCA Analysis**: Interactive Principal Component Analysis to visualize sample clustering
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identify proteins with significant differences between VCF and Control samples
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Hierarchical clustering of samples and proteins
- **ROC Analysis**: Evaluate the diagnostic potential of proteins
- **Protein Visualization**: Detailed visualization of individual protein expression

## Data

The application uses proteomics data from the NULISA-Seq platform, comparing VCF samples with Control samples. The data files are stored in the `data/` directory:

- `Controlonly_samples.csv`: Control sample data
- `VCP_samples.csv`: VCF sample data (Note: The file is still named VCP_samples.csv but the app refers to this as VCF)
- `Control_VCP_metadata.csv`: Sample metadata
